      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We do not require you to create an account or provide personal details. When you load the
        site, we gather non-identifying analytics such as the pages visited, approximate location
        derived from IP address, browser type, and device characteristics. When you run a latency
        test, network requests are issued directly from your browser to AWS regional endpoints; the
        results stay in your session and are not persisted on our servers.

      <h2 class="content-heading">Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h2>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We use cookies and local storage solely to remember your measurement preferences (selected
        regions, units, and filters). These values remain in your browser and can be cleared at any
        time through your browser settings.

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We rely on trusted infrastructure providers to serve static assets and collect anonymous
        usage analytics. These partners process data on our behalf under agreements that safeguard
        your privacy. We do not sell or share your information for advertising purposes.

        You can disable cookies, block analytics scripts, or stop using the service at any time.
        Clearing your browser data will remove stored preferences.
